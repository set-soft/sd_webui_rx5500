# Stable Diffusion WebUI docker images for RX5500XT and similar boards

This project creates [docker images](https://www.docker.com/) ([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)))
to run the [AUTOMATIC1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)
[Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) ([2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion))
web interface on Linux systems equiped with AMD Radeon
[RX5500XT](https://www.amd.com/es/support/graphics/amd-radeon-5500-series/amd-radeon-rx-5500-series/amd-radeon-rx-5500-xt)
and similar boards (i.e. RX5600XT, RX5700XT).

The main features of these docker images are:
- Ready to be used with RX5500XT (all needed options and compatible tools)
- Small size, when compared to other options (2.5 GB compressed image, 10.5 GB uncompressed, for the soft)
- No need to mess your base OS (no need to install stuff on your base system)
